My blog.

It's written in [[file:blog.org][one big org file]] and exported using ox-hugo. If you'd like to see how I've setup CI for this, look at the Makefile, setup.el, and .build.yml to get an idea. (tldr; i just make emacs run a script to export the org file to individual Markdown files, then have hugo generate the site itself)
